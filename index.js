//I need you to list, write descriptions, and categorise the following flavours: "Liquid Shit, Snot, The Baltimore Orioles, Asshole Scabs, Security Camera, Ambiguous Discharge, Vaginal Discharge, Getting Touched at the Doctor for Medical Purposes, Getting Touched at the Doctor for Non-Medical Purposes, Shirley Temple, Adolescent Pimple Fluid, Manatee Period Blood, Justinâ€™s Warm Piss Bottle" Remember, list the flavours using the "flavour1", "flavour2", ... format, and write descriptions using the "flavour1: flavour1desc", "flavour2: flavour2desc", ... format. This is so I can copy and paste them into the .js file.
